# Meme Generator
Generate Memes on the fly

# Getting started
- Clone the directory
- Download a font file and move it to your source folder as `font.ttf`
- Download a series of JPGs and move them to your `./meme` folder
- Make sure the memes have url safe names, such as `roll_safe` or `good_guy_greg`
- Run `go build -o main .` and then `./main` and it will serve from the default port
- You can change the port with the `-port` flag
